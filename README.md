# Substring Matching With Suffix Trees

## 📘 Problem Statement  
**Suffix Trees and DNA Matching**

Given a text string **T** and a set of patterns  
**P = {p₁, p₂, …, pᵣ}**,  
we often want to find all occurrences of any pattern in **T**.

This type of problem appears in **molecular biology**, where known DNA or protein substrings are stored in a library.  
When a new DNA sequence **S** is generated, we want to check:

- Whether any known substring occurs in **S**  
- How many times it occurs  
- At which positions  

### 🧮 Notation  
- **n** — total length of all patterns in P  
- **m** — length of the text string T  
- **k** — number of occurrences of patterns in T

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

This project includes implementations of:

- `naive_algo.cpp` – brute-force pattern matching  
- `extend_part.cpp` – prefix extension & tree operations  
- `string_generator.cpp` – random DNA string generator  
- `Makefile` – easy compilation  
- **`Ukkonen_algo.cpp` (main algorithm used to build the suffix tree)**  

The final suffix tree used for substring search is constructed using **Ukkonen’s Algorithm**, ensuring efficient performance even for large DNA sequences.

## ▶️ Running the Code

 Compile using `make`:
   ```bash
    mingw32-make run
``` 


## 📊 Results & Analysis

- **Ukkonen’s algorithm** builds the suffix tree in **O(m)** time.
- Searching for each pattern takes **O(k + |pattern|)** time.
- Performance is significantly faster than the naïve approach for large DNA sequences.
